This is a Northlayer production.

## Development

First, run the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Start editing from the `pages` or `components` directory and see your changes apply in real-time as you save. 

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
